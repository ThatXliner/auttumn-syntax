*Fall Syntax* is a syntax theme with 3 design points in mind:

 - Reduce [blue light](https://www.verywellhealth.com/blue-light-exposure-3421985)\*
 - Make code clear
 - Still look good


<sub>*does not prevent 100% blue light from monitor. DO NOT USE AS A REPLACEMENT FOR BLUE LIGHT BLOCKING GLASSES. Coding breaks are still recommended.</sub>

### Reduce blue light

Unlike most other themes, this theme aims to **reduce eye strain** by *minimizing* the amount of blue light (which can harm your eyes) shown on the screen. You can call it the opposite of [City Lights][2] 😉.

### Make code clear

This theme has a style-sheet **completely rewritten** from scratch, that helps the programmer **focus**. Some features of this are:

 - *Greying out comments* and string endings
 - Increase color contrast on **function/class definitions**\*
 - Regular expression syntax support

### Still look good

Using **warmer colors**, this theme is reddish and aesthetic, giving that post-summer vibe. Not too neon, not too light.

These colors are also **color contrast tested** to be at least WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) success criterion **1.4.3**.

<sub>*support may vary depending on language</sub>

<sub>**purely (biased) opinion</sub>

This is my first syntax theme 🎉, originally forked from [Atomic-monokai-pro-syntax][1]. Except now, this looks *nothing* like [atomic-monokai-pro-syntax][1]. In fact, I've even completely rewritten the `_base.less` as an optimization.

I hope you like it! ❤️. If you do, **please star this repo and star this theme on Atom**. That way, you can let other people find this theme.

## Installation

This theme can be installed from within Atom or via the command:
```sh
$ apm install fall-syntax
```
After installation, you can activated by going to the **Settings > Themes** section and selecting it from the **Syntax Themes** drop-down menu.

## FAQ

Q: **Hey, did you steal some monokai colors!?**

A: No, great minds think alike

Q: **Why does it look so similar to monokai?**

A: I'm working on making it unique, but yeah: that's the influence. Unlike Monokai, the colors are more warm (and I try to reduce the amount of blue). You can help me make this syntax it's own!

Q: **How can I contribute?**

A: Either ~~complain about the colors~~ professionally critique the theme in the issues or send a pull request for some different colors/arrangements. Or you can **help me port this theme to other editors** I'll merge it if I like it! **Some languages may be poorly syntax highlighted.** If you use those languages, feel free to complain in the issues or send a pull request!
